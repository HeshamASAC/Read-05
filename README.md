CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheet,
CSS allows us to create rules that specify how the content of
an element should appear. For example, I can specify that
the background of the page is cream, all paragraphs should
appear in gray using the Arial typeface, or that all level one
headings should be in a blue, italic, Times typeface.

CSS also Associates Style
rules with HTML elements
